/// it will be refactor. And If there are some concepts are common, 
/// it will be abstracted as implement interface or abstract class.
/// for example: in KFC, there will be some softdrink to be sold, 
/// like coca cola, coff, and so on. And if you wish, you will add some additions like sugar,
/// or ice into softdrinks. If we design the classes as sugar-cocacola, sugar-coff, ice-cocacola,
/// and ice-coff. There will be four subclasses here. And in the future, is there add another
/// additions? If yes, the system will add another two classes! But if use bridge pattern,
/// it will add only one class called "another additions" inherited from addition class. 
/// This is benefits of this pattern.
