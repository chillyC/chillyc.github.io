What A Wonderful World

[  
I see trees of green, red roses too  
I watch them bloom for me and you  
And i think to myself: what a wonderful world  
I see skies of blue, clouds of white  
The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night  
And i think to myself: what a wonderful world  
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky  
Are also on the faces of the people passing by  
I see friends shaking hands, saying: "how do you do?"  
What they're really saying is: "i love you."  
I hear babies cry, i watch them grow  
They'll know much more than i'll ever know  
And i think to myself: what a wonderful world  
Yes i think to myself: what a wonderful world ](http://cn.clyric.com/)
