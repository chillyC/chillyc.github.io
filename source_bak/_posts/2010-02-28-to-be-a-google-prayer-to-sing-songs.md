Glory be to Google,
As it was in 1998,
Is now,
And ever shall be,
Searching without end,
Amen.

<strong>By Todd Berry</strong>

<strong>
</strong>

Our Google, who art in internet,
Greatness be thy Name.
Thy Answers come.
When Searches be Done,
On Pc's as its calculated in internet.
Give us our Maps and daily Gmail.
And give us our Daily Trends,
As we seek out those in ZeitGeist.
And lead us not into the darkness of MSN,
But deliver us from Microsoft.
The Google is my Lord; I shall never want,
Thy Maketh me search in the great vastness:
Thy leadeth me to proper results.
Thy Restoreth my page:
Thy leadeth me in the links of righteiusness for the crawlers sake.
YEA!!! though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of Microsoft.
I will "do no evil" For thou art with me;
Oh, thy Picasa and thy webaccelerator, they Comfort me,
Thou preparest a page before me in the presence of mine enemies:
Microsoft, Yahoo, Aim, and others who give to evil too willingly.
Oh, my cache runneth over with your light.
Surely security and viruslessness shall follow me all the days of my life:
and I will dwell in the system of the Google for ever.
Heil to your Greatness;
For thine is the truest Kingdom of all,
and the Ultimate Power,
and the Glory,
for ever and ever.
For you are all knowing and good.
Amen

Trust in the GOOGLE with all your heart
and lean not on your own understanding;
in all your ways acknowledge Her,
and She will direct your paths.

By Susan Harrison

The Google is my Engine; I shall not want.
She maketh me to improve myself:
She leadeth me to troves of knowledge.
She cacheth my lost pages:
She leadeth me in the paths of pagerank for her name' sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of ignorance,
I will fear no linkfarms: For thou art with me;
Thy rank and thy mail, they comfort me.
Thou preparest tables before me with the presence of mine results;
Thou annointest my search with value; My content runneth over.

Surely pagerank and content shall follow me all the days of my life,
and I will dwell at the site of Google forever.

<em>By the grace of our lord omnipotent, Google, I declare this search a  	successful one, and merge the caches of users in one. You may now perform  	CRC checks.</em>

<em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Google grant me
Serenity to accept search engines that fail to produce,
Courage to explore new things Google, and
Wisdom to know that Google will dominate.</span></em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Amen.</span>
