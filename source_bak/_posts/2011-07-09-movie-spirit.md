Recently, I have watched many movies. And find all of movies have the same spirit: To be a human, not to be alive. This spirit is always in hero movie. Keep away from your desire, you will become stronger. Sacrifice and survival are always discussed in movies. The aspect of education is obvious, and is not funny.
