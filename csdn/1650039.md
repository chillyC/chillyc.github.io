end....

It's good to see the sun and feel this place  
This place I never thought would feel like home  
And I ran forever far away  
And I always thought I'd end up here alone  
Somehow the world has changed  
And I've come home to give you back the things they took from you  
And I feel you now not alone  
When I see myself I always know where you are  
And I found something that wwas always there  
Sometimes it's got to hurt before you feel  
But now I am strong and I won't kneel except to thank who's watching over me  
And somehow I feel so strong and I've begun to be the one I never thought I'd
be  
Now it's all so clear  
And I believe that everything's been opened up to me

middle.......

I am a question to the world not an answer to be heard or a moment that's held
in your arms  
And what do you think you'd ever say I won't listen anyway  
you don't know me and I'll never be what you want made of pain  
And what do you think you'd understand? I'm a boy. no. I am a man  
you can take me and throw me away  
And how can you learn what's never shown  
ywah. you stand here on your own.  
They don't know me cause I am not here

And I want a moment to be real  
want to touch things I don't feel  
want to hold on and feel I belong  
And how can the world want me to change  
They're the ones that stay the same.  
They don't know me  
But I am still here.  
And you see the things they never see.  
All you wanted I could be  
you have known me and I am not afraid  
And I want to tell you who I am  
Can you help me be a man  
They can't break me as long as I know who I am  
They can't tell me who to be cause I'm not what they see  
The world is still sleeping while I keep on dreaming for me.  
And the words are just whisper and lie that I'll never believe  
How can you say I never change.  
They are the ones stay the same  
I am the one now cause I am still here  
I'm one sun still here

my sentiment:  
you give up a few things to chase a
dream.放弃一些事情去追逐梦想。是对是错？没有人说的清楚。在人生的岔路口，走上了一条路，便不能在回头走另外一条路了。  
you must control you own course. Still to it, no matter the storm
comes.必须自己掌握自己的航程，坚持，不管风雨。坚持走自己的路。或许会成功或许失败。谁知道呢？无悔就好。虽然我们都有点点悔恨。  
when the choice come ,hold on the choice to test your really abilities to show
you made of.机会来临，抓住这个表现自己的机会。也许一直都在等待机会，却不知道机会已从自己身边溜走。也许撞上了大运，抓住千载难逢的机遇。谁能预料？
这世间没有教你如果判别机会来了的不二法门。即使遇到了，能否用机会来展示自己，这还是一个难题。所以用平和心对待机会，或许活得更加舒坦些。
