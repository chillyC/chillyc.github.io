Out of the mist of history  
He'll come again  
Sailing on ships across the sea  
To a wounded Nation  
  
Signs of a savoir  
Like fire on the water  
It's what we prayed for  
One of our own  
  
Just wait  
Though while he may roam

Always  
A hero comes home  
He goes where no one has gone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
Deep in the heart of darkness sparks  
A dream of lies  
Surrounded by hopelessness  
He finds the will to fight  
  
Theres no surrender  
Always remember  
It doesn't end here  
We're not alone  
  
Just wait  
Though while he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He goes where no one has gone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
And he will come back on the crimson tide  
Dead or alive  
And even though we know the bridge has burned  
He will return  
He will return  
  
Just wait  
Though while he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He knows of places unknown  
Always  
A hero comes home  
  
Someday they'll carve in stone  
"The hero comes home"  
  
He goes and comes back alone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
Just wait  
Though while he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home
