when you stuck your head, relax, turn and pull. 有时候做人做事要转换一下方式，否则还是会卡住头。  
  
Because all around the planet, there are animals who feel like they cannot,
like a little hamster, who once spends his day in the vehicle park dreaming
the day when he, too, save the little girl from danger and be told, "you did!
you did, rhino. You saved the day." They need a hero, bolt. Someone no matter
what they are or do what is right. They need a hero to tell them that,
sometimes, impossible can become possible, if you are awesome!

我们时常需要一种精神的力量。这或许是人人都喜欢超人的缘故。我们需要一种非凡的勇气去面对这个充满未知艰险的世界。如果有这样一个“超人”告诉我们，前面有路可以到
达目的地，但是只是有些难走。我们就会以为自己误入了迷途。如果说做学问需要老师，大抵如此。可是现实生活中，谁是老师，谁有是那个超人呢？但凡伟人，不过是凡人。

歌词不错，记录如下

I have got so much to give  
I swear I do  
I may not have nine lives  
this one feel brand new  
Yes, I've lived a good one  
I've tried to be true  
There are something I never realized  
Till I met you  
How the wind feels on my cheeks  
When I barking at the moon  
  
There is no home like the one you've got  
cause the home belong to you  
huuu~ Here I come  
Huuu~ back to you  
There is no home like the one you've got  
cause the home belong to you  
  
when I was in trouble bad  
I was so confused  
I may not see in color, baby  
But I sure can feel blue  
I have been a lot of things  
They may not all be true  
My experience was so mysterious  
Till I met you  
Now the sun will rise in the east  
But I barking at the moon  
  
There is no home like the one you've got  
cause the home belong to you  
huuu~ Here I come  
Huuu~ back to you  
There is no home like the one you've got  
cause the home belong to you  
they act they love you,  
they act they will be there for ever,  
Then one day,  they packed all stuff things, and moved away, and take their
love with them!  
And leave their pet defending herself.  
They leave her, wondering what she did wrong.  
cat说的话，这世界总有些人。如同演戏一样，当曲终人散，离你而去。

当然也总有人，they are different!

The hero must go to face their chanllege alone.

当个Hero太痛苦了。独自面对挑战，总有些挑战是要自己去面对的。但是其他的挑战就一起去面对吧。

But if bolt have told me anything, that is never abandon a friend at time you
need.  
When your teammate is in the trouble, you go.  
No matter they asked or not, you go.  
knowing you come back dead or alive, you go.  
When you know the struggle and then present in your mind, you go.

仓鼠的话为啥都是自理名言呢？可爱的小东西。团队中最重要的是相互帮助。为了完成最终的目标，首先要帮助的是成员。如果每个成员都成功的完成了任务，那你的团队还没有
成功吗？

Is that dog looks familiar?  
No, I never see him before my life.

哈哈，人不要太自信，不要太自大。即使是明星，也不一定每个人都认识你。所以每个人都只是凡人，只是小人物。

相信张艺谋、刘德华的名字在某些地方还是未被听到。
